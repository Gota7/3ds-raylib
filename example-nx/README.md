# Nintendo Switch Example
A sample Makefile has been given that needs to be altered with the `# Change this` comments. Notice how all files are relative to the `romfs:/` folder.

## Building
1. `cd` into the raylib `src` directory and run: `make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_NX`
2. Adjust the Makefile in this folder as needed.
3. Run `make` in this folder to get a switch executable.
